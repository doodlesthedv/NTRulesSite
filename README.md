# NTWWC Rules & Guidelines

- Rules
- Moderation Guidelines

# Basic Rules
### 1. No E-Dating/Online Romance
> This is a chatroom to discuss Nitro Type, not for online dating.

### 2. No Swearing / Using Slurs
> Swears & slurs are unnecessary, they just lead to toxicity.
> “Censoring” swears/slurs are not allowed either. (e.g, f**k, s**t)

### 3. Keep Content SFW (Safe for Work)
> The chatroom caters to people under 18, please keep things clean. (Search the definition of NSFW for a list of things not allowed in the chat.)

### 4. Respect Others Privacy, And Your Own
> Please do not post things that may disrupt people’s privacy.
> This includes, but is not limited to, locations, names, passwords, etc.
> Be safe on the internet, do not post photos or videos of yourself, or your locations, names, passwords, etc.

### 5. No Spamming / Flooding The Chat
> Please try your best to keep the chat on topic. This doesn’t mean not to have fun chatting, please just try and not flood the chat with nonsense.


> What you do in one chat doesn’t affect other chats, unless it’s something illegal. So, if you break a rule like swearing, you’ll only be banned from that specific chat. This way, each chat handles its own rules, and you aren’t punished everywhere for one mistake.

> The top statement is null and void if you do illegal activities. 


# Moderation Guidelines
### 1. All Basic Rules Apply To Mods
> Mod's aren't above the rules.
### 2. Moderation Abuse Results In Termination
> Moderators cannot abuse the rules, otherwise their role as moderator will be taken away from them.


# Ban Guidelines
                              
## Level 1. Weak
> This usually goes to people who might break the rule for the first time. Especially cursing. You might give them a warning and let them go without a ban. If this user breaks the rules again, you might LOOSLY ban them. Meaning maybe for an hour, two hours, three hours, etc. 

## Level 2. Moderate
> For people have been the member of the chat for a while and know the rules and tend to break the rules time to time. These users might get a ban for about a day, two days or even a week.

## Level 3. Strict
> (This usually goes to guest users.) There will be people sometimes that come to the chat and flood the chat with curse words or inappropriate images intentionally.
